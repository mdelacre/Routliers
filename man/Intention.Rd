\description{
Participants have to answer to many questions (in a 11-page-survey). For 5 questions (indicated by $$ at the beginning of the question), they are told that there is a correct answer and that they will earn $0.06 if they provide this correct answer.
At the beginning of the experiment, there are also told that they will earn a $0.60 bonus if they choose the answer E on the last question (whatever this is the correct answer or not).
