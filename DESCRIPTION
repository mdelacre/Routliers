Description: Detecting outliers using robust methods, 
 	i.e. the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for univariate outliers and the Mahalanobis-Minimum Covariance Determinant (MMCD)
        for multivariate outliers.There is also the more known but less robust Mahalanobis 
	distance method, only for comparison purposes.
